This is version 1.7.3 of the package, downloaded from itch.io
I modified the main classes by renaming them and making them abstract, because they would not be able to be used in Submerged.

I also created a PowerSpriteAnimator.Editor.asmdef file for the editor classes, because otherwise it wouldn't build.

No other changes have been made.
